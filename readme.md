My forray into Express has ended in complete, and total failure. My understanding of the subject is lacking, and my attempts to seek out resources to help me beyond my instructors and TA's also ended in futility. 

I found my struggles started very early with codealongs. Moving at such a rapid pace did not suit my learning abilities, and caused only more mistakes and errors as i went. That led to me having most of my reference work being functionally useless for me to check back to.

What actually amazed me though was my styling disaster. On Friday I decided to start givng my page a bit of pizazz. Color, centering text, adjusting the fonts, the usual things. And of course add an image into my page header to make a logo. Well that somehow stopped my API from rendering data. Im still in absolute shock of how i managed such a massive error.

My next, and ultimatly fatal issues stemmed from attempting to fix my database in a vain attempt to make an event posting function.  After attempt after attempt to work around my errors, fruitless googling attempts, and youtube tutorials I deemed this project a complete and abject failure.

This project was designed with express, which of course is devil magic disguised as a back-end language.
